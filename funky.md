## Information Collection and Use

We try our best to avoid data collection unless absolutely necessary. As of now, only guild IDs and the voice channel ID are stored to play song in them.


## Security

We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.


## Data Deletion

We do not collect any data from users unless provided us to by user or given permission to do so. If you do want the limited data we collect to be deleted, please contact us at our [support server](https://discord.gg/4Nm7mn2XGC). Please note that participation in servers using Funky after your data is deleted will still be recorded depending on the server settings.
