# Privacy Policy For Gemini

This document entails the privacy policy and agreement that you accept when adding Gemini to a server, or as a member of such a server. This document does not supersede the [Developer Terms of Service](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/terms-of-service).

## Information Collection and Use

We try our best to avoid data collection unless absolutely necessary. The only data we collect about you is the information you provide us when you use our Service. If you delete your Discord account, the data we have tied to that account cannot be used to identify you.

<br>

We may collect additional information when participating in servers with certain Gemini systems enabled. Those features are described below.

<br>

> __Warning__
> 
> All of the below data is only stored if entered by user or given permission to. Gemini won't store any data anonymously! As soon as you stop either of the system the data related to that system will be deleted.

+ `Character system` : Following data is stored while you use character system
    + `guild ID` : guild ID to associate character with
    + `character prefix` : prefix user to trigger character
    + `character prompt` : prompt to define character given using character argument
    + `character username` : username of character to display using webhook

## Security

We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.


## Data Deletion

We do not collect any data from users unless provided us to by user or given permission to do so. If you do want the limited data we collect to be deleted, please contact us at our [support server](https://discord.gg/jAT8k2asTG). Please note that participation in servers using Gemini after your data is deleted will still be recorded depending on the server settings.

Last 100 prompts/user are stored to give precise answers which can be deleted using `!prefix purge` command. Incase, there is any issue or you want us to delete from all characters at once, contact us at [support server](https://discord.gg/jAT8k2asTG).

By using the bot, you consent to the collection, use and transfer of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the bot.
